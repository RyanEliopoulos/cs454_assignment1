@TODO


README needs to include sections explaining reddit credentials.

Stock symbol list is much less static that I had figured. Clearly symbols come in and out
regularly enough to warrant further consideration to deal with it.


AKO/A and AKO/B appear in the symbol list and mess things up. Manually deleted.

Truncating symbol to ignore ^<text> modifiers doesn't completely work.
The different stock classes are fully fledged unique symbols. AHL Doesn't even have a naked
    AHL, ALIN, ALP
value, so the program is throwing an error.


'selftext' field is the contents of the post itself.
'title' is the headline of each post as seen on the site.
Some posts have no 'selftext' and consists entirely of the title. Beware.


['data']['url'] Gives the link to the post.
There is also ['data']['permalink']. Sounds permanent so should use..
